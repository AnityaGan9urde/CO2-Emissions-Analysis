# CO2-Emissions-Analysis
Repository for my work on the analysis of the CO2 emissions all around the world.<br>
[Show Notebook](https://github.com/AnityaGan9urde/Covid-19-Analysis/blob/main/CO2_emissions_analysis.ipynb)
### Dataset: 
- The data for this analysis was taken from the World Bank.
- The data contains information on CO2 Emissions for all the countries from 1960 till 2011.
- Columns:
  - Country
  - Region
  - CO2 per Capita
  - CO2 (in kTon)
### Tableau Dashboard:
- View the dashboard here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anitya.gangurde/viz/WorldwideCO2emissions_16402503766470/Story
### Data Wrangling and EDA:
- Used Pandas to 
- Used Matplotlib to 
### Insights:
- Countries with a constant rise in their CO2 emissions have a better and more stable economy.
- The countries with a irregularity in thier CO2 output in general are poorer and have an unstable environment within the country, politically and economically.
- Developed countries with already having reached their maximum CO2 output and improved regulations on CO2 emissions have started to show a downward trend. Some of these countries have started to go green by using renewable sources more and hence their carbon footprint is reducing.
